I coded this assignment in TypeScript.

I didn't end up changing very much from the original files, for the most part. I started by following the tutorial provided on part of how to do this, then I put the five files through a transpiler to get myself started on converting them into TypeScript, then correcting any of the leftover errors, which generally amounted to importing HTML elements as specific types, something both ChatGPT and my professor helped me out with. The only major element I ended up adding from TypeScript at first was an interface for drawing parameters in canvas.ts. However, near the end of the process, I decided to add more TypeScrypt-specific stuff, like strongly typing various function parameters and variables and adding some function return types. I also ended up adding another interface for ColorStops in canvas.ts at ChatGPT's suggestion (ChatGPT came in handy for taking care of this task).

Additionally, I caught some slight errors from the original, which I corrected. For example, one of my songs wasn't loading in since I had the value written down wrong in av-data.json. Plus, I noticed I forgot to convert a bunch of functions into arrow functions, so I took care of that.
