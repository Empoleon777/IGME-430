                        In terms of the effect nodes, I reused the ones from the Web Audio exercise, while also adding
                        in an allpass filter, a bandpass filter, and a peaking filter. I'm not sure if the last three
                        actually work, though; I've tested them, and I'm not noticing a difference. Maybe I did these
                        wrong because I spent so much time trying to get the Ogerpon gif working.

                        The first sprite is called MovingCircle. This is just a circle that moves horizontally across
                        the screen. I have the program generate tons of them, then pull values from the frequency data
                        to dictate their speeds, then just warp them back to the left edge of the canvas once they reach
                        the right edge. There is an input field that allows the user to change their size (Their radii
                        start at 1 by default).

                        The second sprite is called SoundWave. This is a white circle expanding from the center, its
                        growth rate dictated by the frequency data.

                        The JSON file contains the title of the program, all of the songs (I added a bunch of extra
                        songs, all of which were actually written by me). I also included the drawing parameters in it.

                        I would probably give myself a 0% for the aesthetics portion. I couldn't think of anything
                        clever to do with the visual design, beyond reorganizing the layout in a way that may very well
                        have just made it look worse. I mean, sure, I had the central sound wave and the background
                        circles, but it still doesn't look all that different from the original in most ways, and the
                        sound wave may very well DECREASE its visual quality. I tried to add a horizontally spinning
                        Ogerpon gif, but I couldn't get that to work despite all my best efforts. That was probably my
                        downfall, as I could have potentially added something else if I hadn't spent so much time trying
                        to get this to work out.
